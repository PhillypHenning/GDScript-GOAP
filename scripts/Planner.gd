# 	1. Combines available_actions and static_actions
#	2. Sorts the primary_goals according to their goal_priority
#	3. Creates an empty plan array
#	4. Cycles through each goal in primary_goals
#		a. Attempts to build a plan (an array of actions to take to meet a goal)
#		b. If the plan is returned empty, then it moves on to the next goal
#		c. If the plan isn't empty it returns the plan (Array of actions)
#	5. Return the empty plan
